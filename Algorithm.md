For this project I made a super simple snake game. This was my first time using java swing and I really enjoyed it.
For most of my classes I have been forced to use C++ so mixing it up and going back to java has been nice. 
The snake has collision detection on itself and the boundries.

To run this code all you have to do is type this into your terminal:
javac *.java 

java SnakeGame

this should pull up the window to start my game! I really hope you enjoy it and try to beat my highscore of 37!
